# California_Housing

*Ongoing -* This project was selected as an opportunity for me to actually use some of my knowledge of Sci-Kit Learn in practice. I ran a random forest regressor model, as well as a simple linear regression model, to predict the price of a house in California based on a set of metrics such as proximity to the ocean, median income, and more. See https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices/data (the data source) for more information on what each metric represents. The forest regressor model returned a R Squared score of 0.81 in comparison to 0.67 for that of the linear regression model. Some key steps involved in building these models are in converting text classified metrics to binary, splitting the dataset into training and testing data, and hyperparameter tuning of the random forest regressor model. I intend to further explore this dataset and apply more machine learning models that I have already studied.
